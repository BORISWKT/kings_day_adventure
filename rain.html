                <h2>About Rain</h2>
                <p>Rain is probably the warmest dude in the group, yeah cause we only have two dude in the group.
                   He always takes care of us when something wrong happens, so he just acts like a big brother, or even a <strong>"Father"</strong> to us.
                   He sometimes will throw some punchline to us, the one that we love the most happens when Cynzia said she hasn't planned for a trip for June yet:
                   "It's not that you don't have a plan, it's that you haven't listened to other people's plans."</p>
