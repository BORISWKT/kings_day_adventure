                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi! I'm Boris. The first impression that people usually have about me is either <strong>"Crazy"</strong> or <strong>"Weird"</strong>. That's probably because I always do something that is not normal. HAHAHA
                   That's why when you are looking for a partner to do weird adventures with you, I would probably be the first one to put my hands up.
                   I always like to make laugh of my friends, cause that's the way I show love. Because I think that when both of us can make laugh at each other is the best status that a relationship can be. 
                   Therefore if sometimes I say something goes too far, I want to say sorry for that, and I didn't mean that ^_^
                   </p>
                
                <h3>My Fun Facts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I don't cook a lot before i come to the Netherlands, but now i can cook for my friends with good pastas. (Altough i only know how to cook pasta)</li>
                    <li>I love drinking protein shake, and that's why I fart a lot, if you smell something weird, That's me.</li>
                    <li>I buy a pair of water guns just to shoot my friends and random people during King's Day. So if you feel something wet on you face during King's Day, it's probably me </li>
                    <li>I like girls who can carry good short hair look, I found short hair girls are more attractive than long hair girls.</li>
